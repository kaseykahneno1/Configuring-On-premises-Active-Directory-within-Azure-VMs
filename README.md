<h1>On-premises Active Directory Deployed in the Cloud (Azure)</h1>
In this tutorial, you'll learn how to implement an on-premises Active Directory environment within Azure VMs.<br />


<h2>Environments and Technologies Used</h2>

- Microsoft Azure (Virtual Machines/Compute)
- Remote Desktop
- Active Directory Domain Services
- PowerShell

<h2>Operating Systems Used </h2>

- Windows Server 2022
- Windows 10 (21H2)

<h2>High-Level Deployment and Configuration Steps</h2>

- Set up a Domain Controller in Azure
- Setup Client-1 in Azure
- Install Active Directory
- Create a Domain Admin user within the domain
- Join Client-1 to your domain (mydomain.com)
- Set up Remote Desktop for non-administrative users on Client-1
- Create a bunch of additional users and attempt to log into client-1 with one of the users.

<h2>Set up a Domain Controller in Azure</h2>

</p>
<p>
The first step is to access Azure and create a Resource Group titled AD-Lab. 
</p>
<br />

<p>
<img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/530a1e5d-8494-44ba-85e4-b73867d9c68a" height="80%" width="80%" alt="Disk Sanitization Steps"/>
</p>
<p>
 Then, you'll need to create a virtual network named AD-lab-network, link it to the AD-lab resource group, and choose the same region as in step one.
</p>
<br />

<p>
<img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/892993ca-2997-4e8a-9120-d61dca40a20b" height="80%" width="80%" alt="Disk Sanitization Steps"/>
</p>
<p>
With the virtual network now configured, we can proceed to create our Domain Controller Virtual Machine using Windows Server 2022 and name it DC-1. Assign it to the AD-Lab resource group and place it on the AD-lab-network.
  
- Username: labuser
- Password: Cyberlab123!
</p>
<br />

<p>
<img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6c072edf-3ae3-4f46-9b5c-048614f666d9" height="80%" width="80%" alt="Disk Sanitization Steps"/>
</p>
<p>
Once the virtual machine is created, set the Domain Controller's NIC private IP address to static.
</p>
<br />

<p>
<img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e67af8f3-7fa6-4024-b8bd-f1b1d4c32920" height="80%" width="80%" alt="Disk Sanitization Steps"/>
  
</p>
<p>
To test the network connectivity we will need to log into the VM and disable the Windows Firewall. To do this run remote desktop and log into the private IP address of DC-1 you created earlier. 
</p>
<p>
<img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/61295057-ac31-41db-9592-bf4521ef01fa" height="80%" width="80%" alt="Disk Sanitization Steps"/>
</p>
<p>
Once logged in, run wf.msc
</p>
<p>
<img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/113431b3-2bc3-471d-82b0-2ba52323266d" height="80%" width="80%" alt="Disk Sanitization Steps"/>
<img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c15e54a9-d312-4ac6-b2e0-31c0704bbd34" height="80%" width="80%" alt="Disk Sanitization Steps"/>
</p>
<p>
Then, turn off all firewalls from within the properties menu

</p>
<br />

<h2>Setup Client-1 in Azure</h2>

<p>
<img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/774a13d8-0d8a-4331-bbf2-1659fa4fc21f" height="80%" width="80%" alt="Disk Sanitization Steps"/>
</p>
<p>
Now its time to create the client virtual machine. This will run on windows 10. We will have it assigned to AD-Lab resource groub and on the AD-lab-network. Once again this will need to be placed in the same region as your RG and VN.  
  
- Username: labuser
- Password: Cyberlab123!
</p>
<br />

<p>
<img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c012255a-57bf-4564-b45e-178a331f9b3b" height="80%" width="80%" alt="Disk Sanitization Steps"/>
</p>
<p>
Now we need to set Client-1 DNS settings to DC-1's private IP address. You can find the DC-1 private IP address from the Virtual Machines tab in Azure. Restart Client-1 once completed. 
</p>
<br />

<p>

</p>
<p>
Next, we will want to test our network settings by logging into Client-1 in Remote Desktop and attempting to ping DC-1 through PowerShell.
</p>
<br />

<p>

</p>
<p>
We will also want to test ipconfig/all to ensure the DNS setting is showing DC-1's private IP address while we are in PowerShell.
</p>
<br />

<h2>Install Active Directory</h2>

<p>
<img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/31ee478a-2030-46d9-8726-4e86bb326f9f" height="80%" width="80%" alt="Disk Sanitization Steps"/>
</p>
<p>
Login to DC-1 and install Active Directory Domain Services.
</p>
<br />

<p>
<img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d6c6b21b-92b9-434a-a313-dc43f80ba4ca" height="80%" width="80%" alt="Disk Sanitization Steps"/>
</p>
<p>
Promote as a DC: Set up a new forest as mydomain.com
</p>
<br />

<p>
<img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d3d73d17-e0ef-4160-b0ab-ac0cc6c28d2f" height="80%" width="80%" alt="Disk Sanitization Steps"/>
</p>
<p>
Once the install is complete, the remote desktop session will restart, and then you will log back into DC-1 as user mydomain.com\labuser
</p>
<br />

<h2>Create a Domain Admin user within the domain</h2>

<p>
<img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/52318c34-22ce-4f90-b3fe-65ef8cce54aa" height="80%" width="80%" alt="Disk Sanitization Steps"/>
</p>
<p>
In Active Directory Users and Computers (ADUC), create an Organizational Unit (OU) called “_EMPLOYEES”
</p>
<br />

<p>
<img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/340d5a88-85f4-4643-8110-b938b43af3f6" height="80%" width="80%" alt="Disk Sanitization Steps"/>
</p>
<p>
Create a new OU named “_ADMINS”
</p>
<br />

<p>

</p>
<p>
Create a new employee named “Jane Doe” with the username of “jane_admin” and password of Cyberlab123!
</p>
<br />

<p>
<img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/27b3ffe2-4930-40e8-b429-b352c2255797" height="80%" width="80%" alt="Disk Sanitization Steps"/>
</p>
<p>
Add jane_admin to the “Domain Admins” Security Group
</p>
<br />

<p>
<img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/94349990-9dfc-4ff2-89f5-5cd081a704bf" height="80%" width="80%" alt="Disk Sanitization Steps"/>
</p>
<p>
Log out / close the connection to DC-1 and log back in as “mydomain.com\jane_admin”. User jane_admin as your admin account from now on
</p>
<br />

<h2>Join Client-1 to your domain (mydomain.com)</h2>

<p>
<img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7e1f39d9-75f1-48f8-9cc2-e2adb4482fab" height="80%" width="80%" alt="Disk Sanitization Steps"/>
</p>
<p>
Log in to Client-1 as the original local admin (labuser) and join it to the domain (computer will restart)
</p>
<br />

<p>
<img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4502f607-97e8-4191-889c-c9608300d8c9" height="80%" width="80%" alt="Disk Sanitization Steps"/>
</p>
<p>Log inn to the Domain Controller and verify Client-1 shows up in ADUC
</p>
<br />

<p>
<img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/89eae75b-0773-4f10-b1f5-941473b6986e" height="80%" width="80%" alt="Disk Sanitization Steps"/>
</p>
<p>
Create a new OU named “_CLIENTS” and drag Client-1 into there
</p>
<br />

<h2>Set up Remote Desktop for non-administrative users on Client-1</h2>

<p>
<img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8ea931d4-af9b-48b0-8450-f6f7c978b37c" height="80%" width="80%" alt="Disk Sanitization Steps"/>
</p>
<p>
Log into Client-1 as mydomain.com\jane_admin.
</p>
<br />

<p>
<img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f68418d1-878c-4015-a008-77f40b9f8a26" height="80%" width="80%" alt="Disk Sanitization Steps"/>
</p>
<p>
Open system properties.
</p>
<br />

<p>
<img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e247b46b-83a0-4a0e-9740-dd1d1e3cc558" height="80%" width="80%" alt="Disk Sanitization Steps"/>

</p>
<p>
Enable Remote Desktop access for the “Domain Users” group. You’re now able to log in to Client-1 using a regular user account.
</p>
<br />

<h2>Create a bunch of additional users and attempt to log into client-1 with one of the users</h2>

<p>

</p>
<p>
Try logging into Client-1 using one of the accounts, and make sure to note the password provided in the script.
</p>
<br />

<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>
You now have a complete training system set up for Active Directory. Take some time and practice enabling and disabling accounts, resetting passwords, <a href="https://github.com/kaseykahneno1/configure-group-policy">Configure Group Policy</a></h1>, and more.
